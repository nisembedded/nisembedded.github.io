I'm system and embeded engineer and trying to change the world around me by the technologies and information.
I enjoy [programming](https://github.com/nisembedded), control theory and engineering, mechatronics, robotics, writing articles, reading and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/nis_embedded/). I also love old mechanics, electronics and mechatronic mechanismos and magnetic tape recorders.
