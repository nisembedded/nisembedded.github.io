I'm system and embeded engineer and trying to change the world around me by the technologies and information.
I enjoy [programming](https://github.com/nisembedded), control theory and engineering, mechatronics, robotics, writing articles, reading, [photography](https://www.instagram.com/nisembedded/), and [video blogging](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCZDK_cAVfv_T9gFKulCXUA). I also love old mechanics, electronics and mechatronic mechanismos and magnetic tape recorders.
